/**
 * The {@code net.openhft.chronicle.testframework.internal.process} package provides internal implementations
 * for configuring and launching Java processes within the Chronicle testing framework.
 * <p>
 * This package includes classes that allow customization of JVM arguments, program arguments, classpath
 * entries, and IO behavior for spawned Java processes. It includes implementations of the
 * {@link net.openhft.chronicle.testframework.process.JavaProcessBuilder} interface, providing control
 * over process creation.
 * <p>
 * Usage of classes in this package may be primarily intended for internal use within the framework,
 * rather than direct usage by client code.
